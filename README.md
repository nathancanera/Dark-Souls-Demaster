# Welcome to Dark Souls 0.5!

I use a 2d file renderer and a random room and hallway generation algorithm to make each map.
I took inspiration from FromSoftware's iconic interwoven map to come up with the idea of a random interconnected area generator.

There are interactable enemies with D&D type compbat interactions. As you kill enemies your soul level will increase which increases to your damage rolls!
There are sound effects for different actions and it uses Dark Soul's beloved FireLink Shrine as background music. 

Of course, the iconic bonfire system is still present, allowing you to slowly progress as you fight and inevitably lose to the maps enemies. 

There are also multiple endings similar to the original game as well as a reliable save-to and load-from functionality.
